# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Adithi Murali

Welcome to my digital lair! Here’s everything you never knew you wanted to know about me:

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 🌟 **Code Alchemist** – I turn coffee into C and C++ code (and sometimes just into coffee).
- 🧩 **Problem Solver in Training** – Currently on a quest to master the art of breaking down problems (and sometimes, my code).
- 🌱 **Lifelong Learner** – Learning how to keep my pointers straight, my bugs at bay, and my logic sound.  
  *(If only debugging was as easy as Michael declaring bankruptcy.)*

## 🛠️ Tools of My Trade

- Languages: `C`, `C++`, `very little Python` (yes, you read that right)
- Editor: `VS Code` (with way too many extensions)
- OS: `Anything that compiles C/C++`
- Secret Weapon: One motivational Dwight Schrute quote for every bug, usually its me asking myself "Would an idiot do this?"

## 🦄 Fun Facts

- I believe semicolons are optional, but coffee is not.
- My spirit animal is a panda 🐼—equal parts chill and unexpectedly resourceful. (ALSO I NAP ALOT)
- Sometimes my code is like Kevin’s chili: a beautiful mess—best enjoyed in small portions.
- I still think “Hello, World!” is the best icebreaker.
- I can segfault faster than Michael Scott can say, “That’s what she said.”
- My favorite algorithm is “trial and error.” Just like Michael’s management strategy.
- I may not be assistant to the regional manager, but I am assistant to the really cute monkey stuffy on my desk

## 🚀 My Motto

> "Code like nobody's watching. Because usually, nobody is.And it's okay to not know everything."
