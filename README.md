# üëã Hello, World! I'm Adithi Murali

Welcome to my digital lair! Here‚Äôs everything you never knew you wanted to know about me:

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

- üåü **Code Alchemist** ‚Äì I turn cold coffee into C and C++ code (and sometimes just into coffee).
- üß© **Problem Solver in Training** ‚Äì Currently on a quest to master the art of breaking down problems (and sometimes, my code).
- üå± **Lifelong Learner** ‚Äì Learning how to keep my pointers straight, my bugs at bay, and my logic sound.  
  *(If only debugging was as easy as Michael declaring bankruptcy.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools of My Trade

- Languages: `C`, `C++`, `very little Python` (yes, you read that right)
- Editor: `VS Code` (with way too many extensions)
- OS: `Anything that compiles C/C++`
- Secret Weapon: One motivational Dwight Schrute quote for every bug, usually its me asking myself "Would an idiot do this?"

## ü¶Ñ Fun Facts

- I believe semicolons are optional, but cold coffee is not.
- My spirit animal is a panda üêº‚Äîequal parts chill and unexpectedly resourceful. (ALSO I NAP ALOT)
- Sometimes my code is like Kevin‚Äôs chili: a beautiful mess‚Äîbest enjoyed in small portions.
- I still think ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù is the best icebreaker.
- I may not be assistant to the regional manager, but I am assistant to the really cute monkey stuffy on my desk

## üöÄ My Motto

> "Code like nobody's watching. Because usually, nobody is.And it's okay to not know everything."
